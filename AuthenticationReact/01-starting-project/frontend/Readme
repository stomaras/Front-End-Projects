Decoupled Applications we use authentication tokens 

Create(but not store) "permission"
token on a server & send it to the client
validity can be checked by backend that created that token 
Client attaches token to future requests for protected resources
Server can the verify the attached token

Client ===> Request(with credentials) ===> Server (Back end) ===> Response Auth token
