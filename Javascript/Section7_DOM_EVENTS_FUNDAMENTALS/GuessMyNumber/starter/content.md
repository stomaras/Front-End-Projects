Document Object Model: Strctured REPRESENTATION of HTML Documents.Allows JAVASCRIPT TO ACCESS HTML Elements and styles to manipulte them
                        (Change text, HTML attributes, and even CSS Styles)
                        Tree structure, generated by browser on HTML Load, each html element is an object 
                        we interact with each nodes using javascript.
                        Document is the entry point in the DOM
                        Sibling objects 
                        DOM Methods and Properties for DOM manipulation not part of JS

DOM and DOM methods are actually part of something called web APIs, web APIs are like libraries 
that browser implements and we can access from our js code. JS can interact with WEB APIs
There are more APIs such as Timers fetch APIs and more.
