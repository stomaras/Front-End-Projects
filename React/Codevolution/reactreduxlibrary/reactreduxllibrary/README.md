### connect function

- connect function connect a react component with a redux store

### React Redux + Hooks

React Redux Pattern

Action Creators , reducers, provide the store and connect the components

Components can access state and dispatch actions

React Hooks 

Subscribe to store and dispatch actions without connect()

useSelector = mapStateToProps we already see
useDispatch = mapDispatchToProps we already see returns reference to the dispatch function from the Redux store
