box-sizing:border box : margin and padding does not added on total width and height 
                        of an element so we are getting rid of that behaviour
                        margin, padding, border does not included on total width and height

How to create CSS animations using the @keyframes and the animation property

A css rule

.my-class {
    color:blue;
    text-align:center;
    font-size: 20px;
}

The cascade the c in css: process of combining different stylesheets and resolving conflicts between deifferent css rules and declarations, when more
                          than one rule applies to a certain element.

IMPORTANCE ------------> Specificity ---------------------> Source Order
Default                 1)Inline styles                     
browser declarations    2)IDs
                        3)Classes, pseudo-classes
                        4)Element, pseudo-elements

How CSS is parsed

all units will converted to pixels 
class wins element always
percentage of parent sometimes if we have percentage

each and every css property will have a value specidied value if we do not specify one initial value 0px
for padding initial value is 0px or specified value

for font-size user-agent default size is 16px (Browser default) cascade value 
font-size section: 1.5rem ---> converted to pixels ---> 24px font-size always relative to root unti font-size so 16px * 1.5rem = 24px
paragraph font-size, which is children of section will be --> 24px due to inheritance

em use the parent or the current element font-size as a reference 
rems use the root font-size as the reference

html {
    font-size:16px;

}


header {
    font-size:24;
    padding: 2em == 2 * current font-size == 48px
    margin-bottom: 10rem === 10 * root font-size = 10 * 16 = 160
}

.header-child {
    font-size: 3em; ---> 3 * parent font-size == 72px
    padding:10%
}

CSS VALUE PROCESSING: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

- Each property has an initial value, used if nothing is declared
- Browsers specify a root font-size for each page (usually 16px)
- Percentages and relative values are always converted to px
- Percentages are measured relative to their parent's font-size, if used to specify font-size;
- Percentages are measured relative to their parents width, if used to specify lengths;
- em are measured relative to their parent font-size , if used to specify font-size
- em are measured relative to the current font-size, if used to specify lengths
- rem are always relative to the document'r root font-size;
- vh, vw are always percentage measyrements of the viewport's height and width

some properties inherited other no line-height inherited
Inheritance passes values from some specific properties from parents to childrens
Properties related to text are inherited: font-family, font-size, color etc
Inheritance only works if no one declares a value for that property.
The inherit keyword forces inheritance of a certain property.
The initial keyword resets a property to its initial value.

Box Model:

Content: text, images, etc
Padding: transparent area around the content, inside of the box
Border: goes around the padding and the content
Margin: Space between boxes;
Fill area: are that gets filled with background color or background image 

total width = right border + right padding + specified width + left pdding + left border
total height = top border + top padding + specified height + bottom padding + bottom border

if we set box-sizing: border box , the height and the width will be defined for the entire box including the padding and the border and not just for content area
after we set box-sizing:border-box
total width = specified width 
total height = specified height

Box Types : INLINE, BLOCK-LEVEL AND INLINE-BLOCK

Block-Level boxes:
- Elements formatted visually as blocks
- 100% of parent's width
- Vertically, one after another
- Box-model applies as showed
display:block

Inline-boxes:
- Content is distributed in lines
- Occupies only content's space
- No-line breaks
- No heights and widths
- Paddings and margins only horizontal (left and right)
display:inline

Default: 
position:relative;

Absolute positioning

- Element is removed from the normal flow
- No impact on surrounding content or elements
- We use top, bottom, left, and right to offset the element from its relatively positioned container
position: absolute
position: fixed

Stacking Contexts 
z-index: 3
postion:relative

z-index:2
position: absolute

z-inedx: 1
position: relative

element with the higher z-index appears on top, 
element with lower z-index appears on bottom

only z-index property creating new stacking context

CSS Architecture Components and BEM
------------------------------------------------

Block Element Modifier
BLOCK: standalone component that is meaningful on its own
ELEMENT: part of a block that has no standalone meaning
MODIFIER: a different version of a block or an element 

-----------------------------------------------
THE 7-1 PATTERN
----------------------------------------------
7 different folders for partial Sass files, and 
1 main Sass file to import all other files into a compiled CSS stylesheet.

The 7 folders
- base/
- components/
- layout/
- pages/
- themes/
- abstracts/
- vendors/

What is SASS?
Is a CSS preprocessor, an extension of CSS that adds power and elegance to the basic language

SASS SOURCE CODE ---sass compiler---> COMPILED CSS CODE

MAIN SASS FEATURES:
Variables: for reusable values such as colors, font-sizes, spacing, etc.
Nesting: to nest selectors inside of one another, allowing us to write less code
Operators: for mathematical operations right inside of CSS
Partials and imports: to write CSS in different files and importing them all into one single file.
Mixins: To write reusable pieces of css code.
Functions: similar to mixins, with the difference that they produce a value that can be used 
Extends: to make different selectors inherit declarations that are common to all of them

Basic Responsive Design Principles

1) Fluid Layouts
use max-width instead of width
use % instead of px for elements

2) Responsive Units
use rem instead of px for more lengths

3) Flexible Images
always use % for image dimensions, together with the max-width property

4) Media Queries
To change css styles on certain viewport widths (called breakpoints)
