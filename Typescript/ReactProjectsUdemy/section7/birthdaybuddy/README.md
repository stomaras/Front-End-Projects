#### Import Data

In App.tsx, import the data to be rendered as an array of objects. Each object should represent a person
and contain properties such as name, age, and image url.

### Setup State Variable

Then, set up the data as a state variable using the
useState hook. This will allow the data to be modified
and have those changes automatically reflected in the
rendered output.
