## Steps

#### State Variable

In App.tsx, set up a state variable called
items using the useState hook.

#### Form Component

Create a Form Component that contains an input field
and a submit button. When the user submits the form , the handleSubmit
function is called.

In the handleSubmit function, prevent the default form submission
behavior using event. preventDefault(). If the form is submitted
with an empty value, log a message and return.
