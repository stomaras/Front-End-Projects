## Steps

#### Title Component

First, you need to create a Title component to
display the main title of your app. This component
can be a simple function that retuns a heading element
with the app title.

#### Export and Import Data

Import the menu items data from data.ts into your
project. This data should be an array of objects,
with each object representing a menu item and containing
properties such as title, price, image, URL and description.

#### State Value

Set Up the menu items data as a state variable in the App.tsx
component using the useState hook. This will allow you to modify
the data and have those changes automatically reflected in the rendered
output.
