## Steps

#### Data

Check the data.ts file and find two arrays: one for links
and one for social icons. Notice how icons from react-icons
can be used directly in the data structures.

#### Initial Approach

Set up a Navbar component with a showLinks state value
(boolean). Import the links from data and render them
conditionally in the Navbar based on the showLinks state
value. Set up a button that toggles the value and as a
result, toggles the links. Set up CSS for the Navbar.
