## Steps

#### Examine and Import Data

Review data.ts and import the questions array from
data.ts into your project. This array should contain
objects that represent the questions and their
associated data, such as the question text.

#### Set Up State Value

Next, set up the questions array as a state variable
using the useState Hook. This will allow you to modify
the data and have those changes automatically
reflected in the rendered output.
