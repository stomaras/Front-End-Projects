### Create Components

Create three components : Home , Modal, and Sidedbar. Render them in App.jsx.

a custom hook.

### Global State Values

Set up two state values, both booleans,
isSidebarOpen and isModalOpen.Also, set up
four functions to open and close the modal and
sidebar. Make all these values available in the application.

### Home Component

In Home, set up two buttons and get two functions
from global context, openSidebar and openModal.
Once the user clicks the button, invoke one of the functions.
Set up CSS for the buttons.

### Modal and Sidebar Component

Create a Modal component and add modal CSS.
Repeat the same steps with the Sidebar Component.

The flow of the application should look something
like this:

- Set up two state values, both booleans, isSidebarOpen and isModalOpen.
  Also, set up four functions to open and close the modal and sidebar.
  Make all these values available in the application.
