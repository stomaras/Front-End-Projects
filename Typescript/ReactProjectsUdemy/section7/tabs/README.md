#### Fetch Data

In App.tsx, use the fetch API to get job information
from an external API. Use the useEffect hook to make
the API call when the component mounts. While the data
is being fetched, set up a loading state that displays
a message to the user.

#### State Value.

Once the data has been fetched, store it in a state
variable using the useState hook. This will allow you
to modify the data and have those changes automatically
reflected in the rendered output.
